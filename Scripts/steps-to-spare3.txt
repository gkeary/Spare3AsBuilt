now see if I can connect to spare3\msmlbix from JAKE ??
don't bother because MSMLMSM sql server isn't running.
so...

INSTALL sql server express 2008
http://www.microsoft.com/express/Database/
now it is in and SSMSE runs
but sa password <> 123ross321 and all the ps1 scripts need changing 
for:  a. Spare3\sqlexpress  and b:  123ross321  and usernames...


added users but not to the correct domain.  they are there but this has to be done by hand and it has to be done within the RossExpress domain...
How about VPN access for rgk?

Now we have sqlexpress 2008 installed and it can be connected to from another box.  
conditions for this to happen include:  Firewall off.
   run sqlexpress configuration manager..
     enable tcp/ip in two places
     make sure the Browser service is started (or maybe the sql agent service)
          one of those will start and the other one will not start (for sqlexpress)

    right now the Browser is runnint and the sqlserver service is running.


Make sure they strart up automatically.  Boot the box to test it...
NOTE:  for ps1 files, run  " . ./s3.ps1" on startup -- be sure to source it !

OK, sqlserver came up and I could connect to it from Elwood.

now lets create database logins...
